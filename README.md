# turtlecoin-wallet-backend-cpp
The WalletBackend portion of the main TurtleCoin code pulled out into a standalone repository.

Note: The loading/saving code does not currently function as in the main code base.

Since I developed this for use in android, I removed all the CryptoPP code, as it was causing compilation issues, and I was not going to use that encryption format.

This may be added back at a later date.
